we include our "myheaderfile_funcdef.c" in args in tasks.json file to get automatically build and test by gcc
otherwise I have to give command as "gcc main.c myheaderfile_funcdef.c" 
and then "./a.out" 

You can set other variables also :
    For example I want to set $DISPLAY variable.
    so I will modify my launch.json file and in configuration I'll add the following var name
    "env": [{
        "DISPLAY" : "localhost:10.0"
    }],

    ## done ##
